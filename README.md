## How to Use

    - Click on any post, and the app will redirect you to another page where you can find `comments` at the bottom of the post.

4. **Delete a Post:**

    - On the top right corner, click on the delete button. Note that you can only delete your posts.

    - On the top right corner, click on the edit button. You can only edit your posts.

    - View your profile info by clicking on the `profile` tab.
    - See other people's info by clicking on the `avatar photo` on the top left of each post.

## Features

-   Sign in, up, and out each with its request to the API.
-   Create, update, and delete posts and comment on other people's posts.
-   View and update profile info.
-   See other people's profile info, including their `user_name`, `avatar photo`, `email`, and The total number of `comments`, and `posts` they published.

## Challenges

Dealing with promises and when to update the data was a challenge for me. And what method to use to get what I want from the API.

**How I tackled this challenge**

1. Read the documentation of Tarmeez API to understand the appropriate methods (such as get, post, update, patch, and delete).
2. Reviewed the concepts of promises to better manage asynchronous operations.

## Tools Used

-   JavaScript
-   Bootstrap
-   HTML
-   Axios
-   Tarmeez API
-   Postman
